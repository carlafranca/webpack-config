# webpack config Setup

# Setup webpack with typescript

1. Create a folder for the project and CD into it
2. `$npm init -y` to create the package.json
3. `$yarn add -D webpack webpack-cli`. We can also start with `npx webpack`, it will install and give the hint of what needs to be installed
4. In the package.json add `"scripts": {  "build": "webpack", ...},`
5. Create a folder called "src" and add an index.js file in it.
